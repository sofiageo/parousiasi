TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.
TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.
Existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. 
TypeScript can be used for development of both client-side and server-side execution. 
TypeScript was first made public in October 2012.
Current version 3.6.3.

TypeScript is a language extension that adds features to ECMAScript 6. Additional features include:
-Type annotations and compile-time type checking
-Type inference
-Type erasure
-Interfaces
-Enumerated types
-Generics
-Namespaces
-Tuples
-Async/await

The following features are backported from ECMAScript 2015:
-Classes
-Modules
-Abbreviated "arrow" syntax for anonymous functions
-Optional parameters and default parameters

why use it

Types increase your agility when doing refactoring. It's better for the compiler to catch errors than to have things fail at runtime.
Types are one of the best forms of documentation you can have. The function signature is a theorem and the function body is the proof.
Help along the compiler, and more importantly document stuff for the next developer who has to read your code (that might be future you!).
Enforce that what the compiler sees, is what you thought it should see. That is your understanding of the code matches an algorithmic analysis of the code (done by the compiler).
TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug.
TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand.
TypeScript can help us to avoid painful bugs that developers commonly run into when writing JavaScript by type checking the code. It reduces bugs like null handling, undefined, etc. Strongly typed characteristics restrict developers to write type-specific code with proper checks.
Recent study shows that the use of type results in a 15% decrease of bugs.
TypeScript uses postfix type annotations.
Packages 6995 on npm.
Can be used with Angular, React, VUE etc.
Most polpular IDEs now have Typescript support.
TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking.
